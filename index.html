        <p>I come from Vietnam, so obviously I can speak Vietnamese. I am a freshman of Bachelor of Information Technology. I came to Australia about 3 years ago. Fun fact: I have a cat which is named Theodore and I love it.</p>

        <p>Hi, my name is Haizhou Cheng, you also can call me Eric.I come from China, Shenzhen, which is the first economic zone in China. Because I am Chinese so my first language is Chinese, I am doing undergraduate about Information Technology in RMIT. This is my first time learning knowledge in university and also this is my first time learning something by using English. I am a person with a wide range of interests, I like sport, I can swim, play basketball, table tennis, billiards and so on. Even though I am not really good at it but still enjoy it. Also I really love card, I play all the things contain card, for example poker card game and poke card trick, magic the gathering game, Hearthstone. Next of course is video game. My favourite game is League of legend, second favourite is Blizzard game.</p>

        <p>Hello everyone, welcome to my webpage, let me introduce myself here briefly, I am Zijie Luo from China, you can also call me Damon, now I am studying at RMIT University, majoring in IT courses, my students number is s3809908 and the email address is s3809908@student.rmit.edu.au. If you want to make friends or have any questions, you can contact me via this email address. In fact, I have a small hobby that I especially like cats. I have three cats in China. After I came here, I also have two cats at home. I think cats are good friends of human beings. Getting along with them can make our lives full. Pleasure.</p>

    <h3>Group Processes</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Our group has done a really good job in Assignment 02. We seperate work in different part to make sure each member can done clearly part before the due day. Also we were trying to help each other to reach a higher degree of completion. We don't want to change project idea in Assignment 03. We have done a lot of work in Assignment 02, so we believe we can do a really well work </p>
    </div>
    <br />
    <h3>Career Plans</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Our group plans do work in 4 different jobs. We have code grogrammer, data manager, UI designer and system security Manager. Jason and Eric trying to be a programmer in the future. They prefer to work with software, so both of them choose to be the code programmer. Eric plan to be a data analyst in the future, however he also interest in design so we let him choose UI designer. Zijie and Kaylee wants to be an IT stuff in the future, they need to work with both software and hardware, because of that reason one of them choose to be a data manager and another wants to be a system security manager. Both of them may use some special IT device to complete their part of work.</p>
        <p>OverView</p>
        <p>Topic:</p>
        <p>We plan to do an AI manager,this assistance is a program, which can help users control their information and data. It has very strong privacy and independence,every personal assistance only work on personal's device. Only receive data from the internet and will not send any data to the internet. This assistance have two main functions. Analysis data and keep user's information safe</p>
        <p>Motivation:</p>
        <p>we are interested in this project because this idea comes from filmography "black mirror". There is one episode is talking about copy people's mind data and use this data to build a self-make AI which know everything about you and can serve you about everything in your life. Today, AI is more or less integrated into our lives. it can be seen everywhere.AI itself is not a trend, but the most important technological development in the modern era. It is not a technological trend, but the third computing era after the watchmaking era and the programming era. It connects all aspects of our life, business, and management, such as siri and cortana.If we were able to work on this project,this project can help employer to check all the unread messages, email and phone calls. Then seperate it to different topic, addresser, time and type. Also can able to identify the junk message and email. Can remind the employer check important or hurry mail and send the feedback on time. Second is to keep employer's data and property safe. Assistance control all the money transfer, every transfer need have E-receipt or reason why.</p>
        <p>Landscape:</p>
        <p>The similar systems or products is Siri(Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface).It is AI assistant software built into Apple's iOS system. This software uses natural language processing technology, users can use natural conversations to interact with mobile phones, complete search data, query the weather, set the phone calendar,set alarms and many other services. To compare with siri,our project is more intelligent and functional, it can help users manage their bank accounting and more security. Of course, it can easily do what siri's do and more faster than siri.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Description</h2>
    <h3>Aims:</h3>
    <div>
        <p>Our project is an AI Manager. We hope that the invention of this project can greatly improve the quality of human life in the future. In order to accomplish this, we need to start from a few small purposes, probably user interface design, programming learning, data collection, model testing and tuning, and finally the online operation.</p>
        <p>The first small goal we need to accomplish is the interface design. A good UI design not only makes the software personal and tasteful, but also makes the operation of the software comfortable, simple, free, and fully reflects the positioning and characteristics of the software, User interface design can be divided into three parts: structure design, interaction design and visual design.</p>
        <p>The second is programming learning, which is the most basic part of the project. Recently, there are five popular artificial intelligence programming languages, Python, C++, Java, Lisp and Prolog. One of the most popular is Python. Python's succinct syntax and powerful features have become one of the developers' favorite AI programming languages. Python is very considerate to machine learning, more concise than C++ and Java.</p>
        <p>The third is data collection which is the most important part. Massive data is the foundation of artificial intelligence, AI learns from all the data it has available. The more data it has, the better its insight, Therefore, the upper limit of high-quality data determines the upper limit of machine learning. The role of data in machine learning can be seen. The quality data should be representative, and the skew of data should not be too serious.</p>
        <p>The fourth is the model test. By testing the data, verifying the validity of the model, observing the error samples, and analyzing the causes of the errors, we can often find a breakthrough point to improve the performance of the algorithm.</p>
        <p>The last one is the online operation. When the previous goals are completed and the known problems are solved, the project can be promoted. If we have enough time and resources to complete one of the goals, I think it should be the interface design, which is the first part that needs to be done. With our current ability, we want to write an artificial intelligence programming language that is almost Impossible, and data collection is more time consuming and resource intensive, so I think we should first complete a perfect user interface design.</p>
